Using
-----

After `installing <#install>`__ (and potentially enabling) as
appropriate for your environment, relaunch the Jupyter Notebook: in the
main toolbar, you will get two new buttons that toggle the *Authoring*
and *Presenting* modes.

User Documentation and Community
--------------------------------

When *Authoring*, you can click on the ``(?)`` icon to see a number of
in-Notebook guided tours that show all the features, as well as see
links to community pages:

-  `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nbpresent>`__
   for general or long-term discussion and announcements
-  `issues <https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nbpresent/issues>`__
   for technical issues, as well as feature requests
-  `chat <https://gitter.im/Anaconda-Platform/nbpresent>`__ for quickly
   connecting with other users

Publishing
----------

When you are happy with your presentation, you can download the
standalone HTML file from the *File -> Download as -> Presentation
(.html)* menu item.

Install
-------

    Note: installing directly off this repo won't work, as we don't ship
    the built JavaScript and CSS assets. See more about
    `developing <#develop>`__ below.

``pip``
~~~~~~~

.. code:: shell

    pip install nbpresent
    python -m nbpresent.install

Then either run

.. code:: python

    %reload_ext nbpresent

*every time you start the notebook* or *enable* the extension for every
notebook launch:

.. code:: shell

    python -m nbpresent.install --enable --user

    ``nbpresent.install`` accepts all of the same arguments as
    ``jupyter nbextension install``.

``conda``
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: shell

    conda install -c anaconda-nb-extensions nbpresent

This will enable ``nbpresent`` by default.

Export
------

Stock ``nbconvert`` doesn't store quite enough information, so you'll
need to do something like this:

.. code:: shell

    nbpresent -i notebooks/README.ipynb -o README.html

The resulting file can be hosted and viewed (but not edited!) on any
site.

If you have installed
`nbbrowserpdf <https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nbbrowserpdf>`__,
you can also export to pdf:

.. code:: shell

    nbpresent -i notebooks/README.ipynb -f pdf -o README.pdf

You can also pass in and get back streams:

.. code:: shell

    cmd_that_generates_ipynb | nbpresent -f pdf > README.pdf

Here's the whole doc:

.. code:: python

    !nbpresent --help


.. parsed-literal::

    usage: nbpresent [-h] [-i IPYNB] [-o OUTFILE] [-f {html,pdf}]

    Generate a static nbpresent presentation from a Jupyter Notebook

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i IPYNB, --ipynb IPYNB
                            Input file (otherwise read from stdin)
      -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                            Output file (otherwise write to stdout)
      -f {html,pdf}, --out-format {html,pdf}
                            Output format


Develop
-------

This assumes you have cloned this repository locally:

::

    git clone https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nbpresent.git
    cd nbpresent

Repo Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``nbpresent`` nbextension is built from ``./src`` into
``./nbpresent/static/nbresent`` with: - ``less`` for style - ``es6``
(via ``babel``) for javascript - ``browserify`` for packaging

The ``nbpresent`` python module (server component) is stored in the
``/nbpresent`` folder

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need conda installed, either from
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ or
`miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`__. You can import a
Python 3.5 development environment named ``nbpresent`` from
``./environment.yml``.

.. code:: shell

    conda update env
    source activate nbpresent

We *still* use ``npm`` for a lot of dependencies, so then run:

.. code:: shell

    npm install
    npm run build

Ensure development asset loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that you always get the right assets, install the nbextension
with the ``symlink``, ``force`` and ``enable`` options:

.. code:: shell

    python -m nbpresent.install --overwrite --symlink --enable --user

If developing in a `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`__
environment, you would want to pass in ``--prefix`` instead of
``--user``.
