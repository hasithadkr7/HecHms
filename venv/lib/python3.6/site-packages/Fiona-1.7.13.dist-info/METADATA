Fiona
=====

Fiona is OGR's neat, nimble, no-nonsense API for Python programmers.

Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and
writing data in standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python types
and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and iterators instead of
classes specific to OGR. Fiona can read and write real-world data using
multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and integrates
readily with other Python GIS packages such as pyproj_, Rtree_, and Shapely_.

For more details, see:

* Fiona `docs and manual <http://toblerity.github.com/fiona/>`__
* Fiona `examples <https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/tree/master/examples>`__

Usage
=====

Collections
-----------

Records are read from and written to ``file``-like `Collection` objects
returned from the ``fiona.open()`` function.  Records are mappings modeled on
the GeoJSON format. They don't have any spatial methods of their own, so if you
want to do anything fancy with them you will probably need Shapely or something
like it. Here is an example of using Fiona to read some records from one data
file, change their geometry attributes, and write them to a new data file.

.. code-block:: python

    import fiona

    # Register format drivers with a context manager

    with fiona.drivers():

        # Open a file for reading. We'll call this the "source."

        with fiona.open('tests/data/coutwildrnp.shp') as source:

            # The file we'll write to, the "sink", must be initialized
            # with a coordinate system, a format driver name, and
            # a record schema.  We can get initial values from the open
            # collection's ``meta`` property and then modify them as
            # desired.

            meta = source.meta
            meta['schema']['geometry'] = 'Point'

            # Open an output file, using the same format driver and
            # coordinate reference system as the source. The ``meta``
            # mapping fills in the keyword parameters of fiona.open().

            with fiona.open('test_write.shp', 'w', **meta) as sink:

                # Process only the records intersecting a box.
                for f in source.filter(bbox=(-107.0, 37.0, -105.0, 39.0)):

                    # Get a point on the boundary of the record's
                    # geometry.

                    f['geometry'] = {
                        'type': 'Point',
                        'coordinates': f['geometry']['coordinates'][0][0]}

                    # Write the record out.

                    sink.write(f)

        # The sink's contents are flushed to disk and the file is
        # closed when its ``with`` block ends. This effectively
        # executes ``sink.flush(); sink.close()``.

    # At the end of the ``with fiona.drivers()`` block, context
    # manager exits and all drivers are de-registered.

The fiona.drivers() function and context manager are new in 1.1. The
example above shows the way to use it to register and de-register
drivers in a deterministic and efficient way. Code written for Fiona 1.0
will continue to work: opened collections may manage the global driver
registry if no other manager is present.

Reading Multilayer data
-----------------------

Collections can also be made from single layers within multilayer files or
directories of data. The target layer is specified by name or by its integer
index within the file or directory. The ``fiona.listlayers()`` function
provides an index ordered list of layer names.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        for layername in fiona.listlayers('tests/data'):
            with fiona.open('tests/data', layer=layername) as src:
                print(layername, len(src))

    # Output:
    # (u'coutwildrnp', 67)

Layer can also be specified by index. In this case, ``layer=0`` and
``layer='test_uk'`` specify the same layer in the data file or directory.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        for i, layername in enumerate(fiona.listlayers('tests/data')):
            with fiona.open('tests/data', layer=i) as src:
                print(i, layername, len(src))

    # Output:
    # (0, u'coutwildrnp', 67)

Writing Multilayer data
-----------------------

Multilayer data can be written as well. Layers must be specified by name when
writing.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        with open('tests/data/cowildrnp.shp') as src:
            meta = src.meta
            f = next(src)

        with fiona.open('/tmp/foo', 'w', layer='bar', **meta) as dst:
            dst.write(f)

        print(fiona.listlayers('/tmp/foo'))

        with fiona.open('/tmp/foo', layer='bar') as src:
            print(len(src))
            f = next(src)
            print(f['geometry']['type'])
            print(f['properties'])

        # Output:
        # [u'bar']
        # 1
        # Polygon
        # OrderedDict([(u'PERIMETER', 1.22107), (u'FEATURE2', None), (u'NAME', u'Mount Naomi Wilderness'), (u'FEATURE1', u'Wilderness'), (u'URL', u'http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&wname=Mount%20Naomi'), (u'AGBUR', u'FS'), (u'AREA', 0.0179264), (u'STATE_FIPS', u'49'), (u'WILDRNP020', 332), (u'STATE', u'UT')])

A view of the /tmp/foo directory will confirm the creation of the new files.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ls /tmp/foo
    bar.cpg bar.dbf bar.prj bar.shp bar.shx

Collections from archives and virtual file systems
--------------------------------------------------

Zip and Tar archives can be treated as virtual filesystems and Collections can
be made from paths and layers within them. In other words, Fiona lets you read
and write zipped Shapefiles.

.. code-block:: python

    with fiona.drivers():

        for i, layername in enumerate(
                fiona.listlayers(
                    '/', 
                    vfs='zip://tests/data/coutwildrnp.zip')):
            with fiona.open(
                    '/', 
                    vfs='zip://tests/data/coutwildrnp.zip', 
                    layer=i) as src:
                print(i, layername, len(src))

    # Output:
    # (0, u'coutwildrnp', 67)

Fiona CLI
=========

Fiona's command line interface, named "fio", is documented at `docs/cli.rst
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/blob/master/docs/cli.rst>`__. Its ``fio
info`` pretty prints information about a data file.

.. code-block:: console

    $ fio info --indent 2 tests/data/coutwildrnp.shp
    {
      "count": 67,
      "crs": "EPSG:4326",
      "driver": "ESRI Shapefile",
      "bounds": [
        -113.56424713134766,
        37.0689811706543,
        -104.97087097167969,
        41.99627685546875
      ],
      "schema": {
        "geometry": "Polygon",
        "properties": {

          "NAME": "str:80",
          "FEATURE1": "str:80",
          "URL": "str:101",
          "AGBUR": "str:80",
          "AREA": "float:24.15",
          "STATE_FIPS": "str:80",
          "WILDRNP020": "int:10",
          "STATE": "str:80"
        }
      }
    }

Installation
============

Fiona requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, or 3.4 and GDAL/OGR 1.8+. To build from
a source distribution you will need a C compiler and GDAL and Python
development headers and libraries (libgdal1-dev for Debian/Ubuntu, gdal-dev for
CentOS/Fedora).

To build from a repository copy, you will also need Cython to build C sources
from the project's .pyx files. See the project's requirements-dev.txt file for
guidance.

The `Kyngchaos GDAL frameworks
<http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete>`__ will satisfy
the GDAL/OGR dependency for OS X, as will Homebrew's GDAL Formula (``brew install
gdal``).

Python Requirements
-------------------

Fiona depends on the modules ``six``, ``cligj``,  ``munch``, ``argparse``, and
``ordereddict`` (the two latter modules are standard in Python 2.7+). Pip will
fetch these requirements for you, but users installing Fiona from a Windows
installer must get them separately.

Unix-like systems
-----------------

Assuming you're using a virtualenv (if not, skip to the 4th command) and
GDAL/OGR libraries, headers, and `gdal-config`_ program are installed to well
known locations on your system via your system's package manager (``brew
install gdal`` using Homebrew on OS X), installation is this simple.

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir fiona_env
  $ virtualenv fiona_env
  $ source fiona_env/bin/activate
  (fiona_env)$ pip install fiona

If gdal-config is not available or if GDAL/OGR headers and libs aren't
installed to a well known location, you must set include dirs, library dirs,
and libraries options via the setup.cfg file or setup command line as shown
below (using ``git``). You must also specify the major version of the GDAL API
(1 or 2) on the setup command line.

.. code-block:: console

  (fiona_env)$ git clone git://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona.git
  (fiona_env)$ cd Fiona
  (fiona_env)$ python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/gdal/include -L/path/to/gdal/lib -lgdal install --gdalversion 1

Or specify that build options and GDAL API version should be provided by a
particular gdal-config program.

.. code-block:: console

  (fiona_env)$ GDAL_CONFIG=/path/to/gdal-config pip install fiona

Windows
-------

Binary installers are available at
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona and coming eventually to PyPI.

You can download a binary distribution of GDAL from `here
<http://www.gisinternals.com/release.php>`_.  You will also need to download
the compiled libraries and headers (include files).

When building from source on Windows, it is important to know that setup.py
cannot rely on gdal-config, which is only present on UNIX systems, to discover 
the locations of header files and libraries that Fiona needs to compile its 
C extensions. On Windows, these paths need to be provided by the user. 
You will need to find the include files and the library files for gdal and 
use setup.py as follows. You must also specify the major version of the GDAL
API (1 or 2) on the setup command line.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py build_ext -I<path to gdal include files> -lgdal_i -L<path to gdal library> install --gdalversion 1

Note: The GDAL dll (gdal111.dll) and gdal-data directory need to be in your 
Windows PATH otherwise Fiona will fail to work.

Development and testing
=======================

Building from the source requires Cython. Tests require Nose. If the GDAL/OGR
libraries, headers, and `gdal-config`_ program are installed to well known
locations on your system (via your system's package manager), you can do this::

  (fiona_env)$ git clone git://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona.git
  (fiona_env)$ cd Fiona
  (fiona_env)$ pip install cython
  (fiona_env)$ pip install -e .[test]
  (fiona_env)$ nosetests

Or you can use the ``pep-518-install`` script::

  (fiona_env)$ git clone git://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona.git
  (fiona_env)$ cd Fiona
  (fiona_env)$ ./pep-518-install

If you have a non-standard environment, you'll need to specify the include and
lib dirs and GDAL library on the command line::

  (fiona_env)$ python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/gdal/include -L/path/to/gdal/lib -lgdal --gdalversion 2 develop
  (fiona_env)$ nosetests

Changes
=======

All issue numbers are relative to https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues.

1.7.13 (2018-07-17)
-------------------

In GDAL 2.2, the behavior of GDAL with respect to null fields changed (#460).
A fix in the master (1.8-to-be) branch has been back-ported so that Fiona's
results with GDAL 2.1 and 2.2 are the same. The value reported for unset
integer or string fields will be `None` and not `0` or `""`.

1.7.12 (2018-06-11)
-------------------

- Require six>=1.7
- Include sqlite 3.24.0 in macosx wheels (frs-wheel-builds 1.8.2).

1.7.11.post2 (2018-04-30)
-------------------------

- This post-release adds GPKG (geopackage) support to manylinux1 wheels
  and upgrades the included GDAL library to 2.2.4.

1.7.11.post1 (2018-01-08)
-------------------------

- This post-release adds missing expat (and thereby GPX format) support to 
  the included GDAL library (still version 2.2.2).

1.7.11 (2017-12-14)
-------------------

- The ``encoding`` keyword argument for ``fiona.open()``, which is intended
  to allow a caller to override a data source's own and possibly erroneous
  encoding, has not been working (#510, #512). The problem is that we weren't
  always setting GDAL open or config options before opening the data sources.
  This bug is resolved by a number of commits in the maint-1.7 branch and
  the fix is demonstrated in tests/test_encoding.py.
- An ``--encoding`` option has been added to fio-load to enable creation of
  encoded shapefiles with an accompanying .cpg file (#499, #517).

1.7.10.post1 (2017-10-30)
-------------------------

- A post-release has been made to fix a problem with macosx wheels uploaded
  to PyPI.

1.7.10 (2017-10-26)
-------------------

Bug fixes:

- An extraneous printed line from the ``rio cat --layers`` validator has been
  removed (#478).

Packaging:

- Official OS X and Manylinux1 wheels (on PyPI) for this release will be
  compatible with Shapely 1.6.2 and Rasterio 1.0a10 wheels.

1.7.9.post1 (2017-08-21)
------------------------

This release introduces no changes in the Fiona package. It upgrades GDAL
from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 in wheels that we publish to the Python Package Index.

1.7.9 (2017-08-17)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Acquire the GIL for GDAL error callback functions to prevent crashes when
  GDAL errors occur when the GIL has been released by user code.
- Sync and flush layers when closing even when the number of features is not
  precisely known (#467).

1.7.8 (2017-06-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Provide all arguments needed by CPLError based exceptions (#456).

1.7.7 (2017-06-05)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Switch logger `warn()` (deprecated) calls to `warning()`.
- Replace all relative imports and cimports in Cython modules with absolute
  imports (#450).
- Avoid setting `PROJ_LIB` to a non-existent directory (#439).

1.7.6 (2017-04-26)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fall back to `share/proj` for PROJ_LIB (#440).
- Replace every call to `OSRDestroySpatialReference()` with `OSRRelease()`,
  fixing the GPKG driver crasher reported in #441 (#443).
- Add a `DriverIOError` derived from `IOError` to use for driver-specific
  errors such as the GeoJSON driver's refusal to overwrite existing files.
  Also we now ensure that when this error is raised by `fiona.open()` any
  created read or write session is deleted, this eliminates spurious 
  exceptions on teardown of broken `Collection` objects (#437, #444).

1.7.5 (2017-03-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Opening a data file in read (the default) mode with `fiona.open()` using the
  the `driver` or `drivers` keyword arguments (to specify certain format 
  drivers) would sometimes cause a crash on Windows due to improperly
  terminated lists of strings (#428). The fix: Fiona's buggy `string_list()`
  has been replaced by GDAL's `CSLAddString()`.

1.7.4 (2017-02-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- OGR's EsriJSON detection fails when certain keys aren't found in the first
  6000 bytes of data passed to `BytesCollection` (#422). A .json file extension
  is now explicitly given to the in-memory file behind `BytesCollection` when
  the `driver='GeoJSON'` keyword argument is given (#423). 

1.7.3 (2017-02-14)
------------------

Roses are red.
Tan is a pug.
Software regression's
the most embarrassing bug.

Bug fixes:

- Use __stdcall for GDAL error handling callback on Windows as in Rasterio.
- Turn on latent support for zip:// URLs in rio-cat and rio-info (#421).
- The 1.7.2 release broke support for zip files with absolute paths (#418).
  This regression has been fixed with tests to confirm.

1.7.2 (2017-01-27)
------------------

Future Deprecation:

- `Collection.__next__()` is buggy in that it can lead to duplication of 
  features when used in combination with `Collection.filter()` or
  `Collection.__iter__()`. It will be removed in Fiona 2.0. Please check for
  usage of this deprecated feature by running your tests or programs with
  `PYTHONWARNINGS="always:::fiona"` or `-W"always:::fiona"` and switch from
  `next(collection)` to `next(iter(collection))` (#301).

Bug fix:

- Zipped streams of bytes can be accessed by `BytesCollection` (#318).

1.7.1.post1 (2016-12-23)
------------------------
- New binary wheels using version 1.2.0 of sgillies/frs-wheel-builds. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/blob/master/CHANGES.txt.

1.7.1 (2016-11-16)
------------------

Bug Fixes:

- Prevent Fiona from stumbling over 'Z', 'M', and 'ZM' geometry types
  introduced in GDAL 2.1 (#384). Fiona 1.7.1 doesn't add explicit support for
  these types, they are coerced to geometry types 1-7 ('Point', 'LineString',
  etc.)
- Raise an `UnsupportedGeometryTypeError` when a bogus or unsupported 
  geometry type is encountered in a new collection's schema or elsewhere
  (#340).
- Enable `--precision 0` for fio-cat (#370).
- Prevent datetime exceptions from unnecessarily stopping collection iteration
  by yielding `None` (#385)
- Replace log.warn calls with log.warning calls (#379).
- Print an error message if neither gdal-config or `--gdalversion` indicate
  a GDAL C API version when running `setup.py` (#364).
- Let dict-like subclasses through CRS type checks (#367).

1.7.0post2 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: define extension modules for 'clean' and 'config' targets (#363).

1.7.0post1 (2016-06-15)
-----------------------

Packaging: No files are copied for the 'clean' setup target (#361, #362).

1.7.0 (2016-06-14)
------------------

The C extension modules in this library can now be built and used with either
a 1.x or 2.x release of the GDAL library. Big thanks to René Buffat for
leading this effort.

Refactoring:

- The `ogrext1.pyx` and `ogrext2.pyx` files now use separate
  C APIs defined in `ogrext1.pxd` and `ogrex2.pxd`. The other extension
  modules have been refactored so that they do not depend on either of these
  modules and use subsets of the GDAL/OGR API compatible with both GDAL 1.x and
  2.x (#359).

Packaging:

- Source distributions now contain two different sources for the
  `ogrext` extension module. The `ogrext1.c` file will be used with GDAL 1.x
  and the `ogrext2.c` file will be used with GDAL 2.x.

1.7b2 (2016-06-13)
------------------

- New feature: enhancement of the `--layer` option for fio-cat and fio-dump
  to allow separate layers of one or more multi-layer input files to be
  selected (#349).

1.7b1 (2016-06-10)
------------------

- New feature: support for GDAL version 2+ (#259).
- New feature: a new fio-calc CLI command (#273).
- New feature: `--layer` options for fio-info (#316) and fio-load (#299).
- New feature: a `--no-parse` option for fio-collect that lets a careful user
  avoid extra JSON serialization and deserialization (#306).
- Bug fix: `+wktext` is now preserved when serializing CRS from WKT to PROJ.4
  dicts (#352).
- Bug fix: a small memory leak when opening a collection has been fixed (#337).
- Bug fix: internal unicode errors now result in a log message and a 
  `UnicodeError` exception, not a `TypeError` (#356).

1.6.4 (2016-05-06)
------------------
- Raise ImportError if the active GDAL library version is >= 2.0 instead of
  failing unpredictably (#338, #341). Support for GDAL>=2.0 is coming in
  Fiona 1.7.

1.6.3.post1 (2016-03-27)
------------------------
- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a
  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Fiona more
  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the
  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/issues/5.

1.6.3 (2015-12-22)
------------------
- Daytime has been decreasing in the Northern Hemisphere, but is now
  increasing again as it should.
- Non-UTF strings were being passed into OGR functions in some situations
  and on Windows this would sometimes crash a Python process (#303). Fiona
  now raises errors derived from UnicodeError when field names or field
  values can't be encoded.

1.6.2 (2015-09-22)
------------------
- Providing only PROJ4 representations in the dataset meta property resulted in
  loss of CRS information when using the `fiona.open(..., **src.meta) as dst`
  pattern (#265). This bug has been addressed by adding a crs_wkt item to the`
  meta property and extending the `fiona.open()` and the collection constructor
  to look for and prioritize this keyword argument.

1.6.1 (2015-08-12)
------------------
- Bug fix: Fiona now deserializes JSON-encoded string properties provided by
  the OGR GeoJSON driver (#244, #245, #246).
- Bug fix: proj4 data was not copied properly into binary distributions due to
  a typo (#254).

- Manage one iterator per collection/session.
- Added a read-only bounds property.

0.7 (2012-01-29)

  these field types if you can avoid them. RFC 3339 datetimes in a string field
  are much better.

0.6.2 (2012-01-10)
------------------
- Diagnose and set the driver property of collection in read mode.
- Fail if collection paths are not to files. Multi-collection workspaces are
  a (maybe) TODO.
